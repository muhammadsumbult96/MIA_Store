# Conventional Commit Messages Specification

Use the Conventional Commits specification for all commit messages in this project.

## Commit message structure

<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]


## Structural elements

- fix: a commit of type `fix` patches a bug in your codebase (corresponds to PATCH in Semantic Versioning)
- feat: a commit of type `feat` introduces a new feature (corresponds to MINOR in Semantic Versioning)
- BREAKING CHANGE: a commit that has a footer `BREAKING CHANGE:`, or appends a `!` after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (corresponds to MAJOR in Semantic Versioning). BREAKING CHANGE can be part of any commit type.
- Other types are allowed (e.g., build:, chore:, ci:, docs:, style:, refactor:, perf:, test:) and may follow the Angular convention.
- Footers other than BREAKING CHANGE:<description> may be provided, in a style similar to the git trailer format.
- Additional types are not mandated by the Conventional Commits specification and have no implicit effect on Semantic Versioning (unless they include a BREAKING CHANGE). A scope may be provided as part of the commit’s type for extra context, e.g., `feat(parser): add ability to parse arrays`.

## Specification details

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

- Commits **MUST** be prefixed with a type (e.g., feat, fix), followed by optional scope, optional `!`, and a required terminal colon and space.
- The type `feat` **MUST** be used when a commit adds a feature.
- The type `fix` **MUST** be used for bug fixes.
- A scope **MAY** be provided after a type, in parentheses, e.g., `fix(parser):`.
- A description **MUST** immediately follow the colon and space after the type/scope.
- An optional body **MAY** be included after a blank line; it can be any free-form markdown.
- One or more footers **MAY** be included after another blank line. Each footer **MUST** use the format `token: value` or `token #value`. Use `-` instead of whitespace in tokens (except BREAKING CHANGE).
- BREAKING CHANGE must be indicated in the type/scope prefix (using `!`) or as a footer.
- If included as a footer, a breaking change **MUST** use the uppercase `BREAKING CHANGE:` followed by a description.
- If `!` is used in the type/scope prefix, `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer is optional; the commit description acts as the breaking change description.
- Types other than `feat` and `fix` may be used, e.g., `docs: update ref docs`.
- All parts of a Conventional Commit except BREAKING CHANGE are case-insensitive.
- BREAKING-CHANGE (with dash) is synonymous with BREAKING CHANGE (with space) when used in a footer.
